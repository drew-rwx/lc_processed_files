# lc_processed_files

Each folder is named after the original input (reaction_diffusion_test_functions.bin or reaction_diffusion_training_functions.bin). In each folder, the files are prepended with what pipeline was used to process that file. For example, the file `ABS(0.1).BIT_4.reaction_diffusion_test_functions.bin` was first quantized using an absolute error bound of 0.1, then the BIT_4 component was used.
